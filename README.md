[originex.xyz](http://www.originex.xyz/)

This app was developed as the final project of the 9 weeks bootcamp from [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/). It was designed, developed and implemented in the last two weeks from scratch, using **Ruby on Rails** mostly, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL. 

The main idea of the web is to offer the user activities related with his/her interests (which they can edit when creating an account). As you navigate the web, you can see scheduled events of these activities and the people participating in those events, you can join different chatrooms related with the activities, invite people to join the chatroom, create new events or join existing ones.
